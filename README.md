# Proximity-Trinkey-Pomodoro
Using the Adafruit Proximity Trinkey.

---

## I haven't seen a lot of projects for the Adafruit Proximity Trinkey, so I created a Pomodoro Clock for it.
You can review the code and see the comments for instructions on how to use it.

Here is a link to some USB mounts in case it doesn't fit your USB port:
[USB Trinkey Keyboard Mount](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/k7q1ivGozkE-usb-trinkey-keyboard-mount-v1/edit?sharecode=D08e9BRqEQPz5z1lhJB7-ClI34iRDSlJoocByhCeAKo)

I've included the Tinkercad link with designs that have 0.4mm and 0.2mm clearances, depending on your USB port.
